# Navigation Refactor Complete

## Summary
Successfully refactored the navigation from param-based (`?view=`) to proper Next.js routes while preserving the background animations.

## Changes Made

### 1. Background Animation System
- Created `/components/persistent-background.tsx` that manages the persistent background image
- Background stays mounted and never re-renders during navigation
- Animation logic based on route depth:
  - `/` (home): No zoom, no blur
  - `/trade`, `/play`: 110% zoom, slight blur
  - `/p2p`, `/marketplace`, `/casual`, `/launchpad`, `/museum`, `/studio`: 125% zoom, medium blur
- All animations use CSS transitions with 500ms duration

### 2. Route Structure
Created individual route pages:
- `/app/trade/page.tsx` - Trade view
- `/app/play/page.tsx` - Play view  
- `/app/p2p/page.tsx` - P2P trading
- `/app/marketplace/page.tsx` - NFT marketplace
- `/app/casual/page.tsx` - Casual games
- `/app/launchpad/page.tsx` - NFT launchpad
- `/app/museum/page.tsx` - Museum/gallery
- `/app/studio/page.tsx` - NFT studio

### 3. Shared Components
- `/components/layouts/authenticated-layout.tsx` - Shared layout for authenticated views
- Updated `/components/conditional-layout.tsx` to use PersistentBackground for authenticated routes

### 4. Navigation Updates
- All navigation now uses `router.push()` instead of `setViewMode()`
- Browser back button properly triggers reverse animations
- Background persists across all route changes

## How It Works

1. **Persistent Background**: The background image is mounted once in `PersistentBackground` component and never unmounts during navigation.

2. **Animation Logic**: Based on the current pathname, the component applies different CSS classes for zoom and blur effects.

3. **Route Navigation**: When navigating between routes, only the foreground content changes while the background stays persistent and animates smoothly.

4. **Browser History**: Using proper Next.js routes means the browser back/forward buttons work correctly and trigger the appropriate animations.

## Testing
The implementation maintains all existing animations:
- Forward navigation (deeper routes) triggers zoom in + blur
- Backward navigation triggers zoom out + unblur
- Background never reloads or flickers during navigation
- All transitions are smooth and continuous

## Backup
Original studio route backed up to `/app/_backup_routes/studio/` before replacement.
